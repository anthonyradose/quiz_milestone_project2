## Testing

### Principles Of Testing

Automated testing offers repeatability, consistency, efficiency, and is best suited for regression testing, large test suites, frequent execution, and performance testing. 

Manual testing excels in user experience evaluation, usability testing, complex scenarios, and initial testing. 

A balanced approach, leveraging both automated and manual testing, ensures comprehensive coverage throughout the development process.
 
Automated testing suits repetitive tasks, while manual testing is valuable for scenarios requiring human intuition and creativity.

## Deployment

I deployed the website initially using Codeanywhere and later continued development using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Here are the steps I followed:

**With Codeanywhere:**

1. Created a new repository on GitHub by logging into my GitHub account and selecting "New" repository.

2. Named the repository "quiz_milestone_project2" and added a brief description.

3. Selected the desired options for repository visibility (public or private) and created the repository.

4. Once the repository was created, I navigated to the repository page on GitHub.

5. Logged into Codeanywhere.

6. Clicked on New Workspace.

7. Copied the repository url into the Create From Your Project Repository box.

8. This action automatically launched the CodeAnywhere IDE, providing me with an online development environment preconfigured with the repository.

9. Developed and tested the website within the Codeanywhere workspace, using the Codeanywhere IDE features and tools.

10. Previewed the website by launching a local server within Codeanywhere.

11. Accessed the live preview of the website in the browser within the Codeanywhere workspace.

12. The site was fully deployed and accessible for testing and demonstration purposes within Codeanywhere.

**With VScode:**

1. Cloned the Git repository to a local directory using the following command:
   git clone `https://github.com/myusername/quiz_milestone_project2.git`

2. Opened the project folder in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) by selecting "Open Folder" from the File menu and choosing the appropriate directory.

3. Made any necessary changes and committed them to the Git repository using the following commands:  
   Add changes:  
   `git add .`  
   Commit changes:  
   `git commit -m "Added x feature to..."`.  
   Pushed the changes to the GitHub repository:  
   `git push origin main`

4. Opened any of the HTML files (e.g., index.html, tour.html, media.html, etc.) in a web browser of my choice directly from the local project directory.

**Fork and Clone Repository:**

1. Visit the GitHub repository and click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. On your forked repository's page, click on the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.

3. Open your preferred Command Line Interface (e.g., Terminal, Git Bash) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

4. Enter the following command in the command line:
   `git clone [repository URL]`

5. Navigate into the Repository: Use the cd command to navigate into the cloned repository:
   `cd [repository name]`

(Replace [repository URL] with the actual URL of your forked repository and [repository name] with the name of the cloned repository on your local machine.)
